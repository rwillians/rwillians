### Hi there 👋

I'm a product-minded **Backend Software Engineer** with a keen
interest in **Developer Experience**.

I've worked mostly in startups and fast-paced projects, so I'm used to
wearing many hats and learning new things quickly. I prioritize
understanding the business and the users' needs so that I can build
the best feasible solutions. I specially like working with decisions
driven by data using **Hypothesis-Driven Development**.

- 📓 I've done a lot of work on Double-Entry Bookkeeping Accounting systems in Elixir with Event Sourcing — there's a link to my lib at the bottom.
- 🔭 I'm currently looking into an architecture for processing high-volume operations (mostly integrations syncing) with log retention, telemetry and data visualization meant for engineering teams easily develop background jobs for and easily get insights from their jobs' stats.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about designing programming languages, and I'm designing a statically typed one using Set Theoretic Types just for fun.
- 🤔 I’m looking for collaborations on how to scale Double-Entry Bookkeeping systems, since they are naturally so bound to sequencial operations per ledger.
- 💬 Ask me about Elixir, JavaScript, Node.js, HTTP Servers, middleware stack applications, Double-Entry Bookeeping, Financial Accounting, DevOps, CI/CD, Event Sourcing, CQRS, etc.
- 📫 You can also find me on 𝕏 Twitter: at [`@rwillians_`](https://twitter.com/rwillians_) and at [`@rwillians.bsky.social`](https://bsky.app/profile/rwillians.bsky.social).
- 📑 You can find my publishings on dev.to (the place is a bit empty thought, I'm still moving my stuff to there): [`@rwillians`](https://dev.to/rwillians).


### Recommendations

- 📑 You might be interested in my [introduction to Double-Entry Bookkeeping Accounting](https://dev.to/rwillians/double-entry-bookkeeping-101-for-software-engineers-bk4).
- 👨‍💻 You might be interested in [Bookk](https://github.com/rwillians/bookk), my Elixir/Erlang library that provides the building blocks for operating ledgers using Double-Entry Bookkeeping.
- 🛟 [express-rescue](https://github.com/rwillians/express-rescue): this is an old one but still used alot even after [express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) got "native" support for async middlewares. Although its primary purpose — make it safe to run async middleware functions in express — is not longer needed, it still adds valeu by enabling developers to create cleaner code thanks to the `rescue.from(errorClass, handler)` function, which gives you the abality to selectively handle errors based on their class name. It's a really small lib and I encurage you to replace it with a single function in your codebase. The important thing here is the idea of how to organize your middlewares and have error handlers that are specific to a route that can translate domain errors to HTTP errors.

Here you'll find some of my OSS projects that I like the most:
- [**`bookk`**](https://github.com/rwillians/bookk): building blocks
  for building double-entry bookkeeping accounting systems in Elixir.
- [**`fykit`**](https://github.com/rwillians/fykit): a collection of
  libraries for building web services in JavaScript.
- [**`express-rescue`**](https://github.com/rwillians/express-rescue):
  a library for handling errors in Express.js with a syntax similiar
  to Ruby's `rescue`.
