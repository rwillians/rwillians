### Hi there 👋

I'm a product-minded **Backend Software Engineer** with a keen
interest in **Developer Experience**.

I've worked mostly in startups and fast-paced projects, so I'm used to
wearing many hats and learning new things quickly. I prioritize
understanding the business and the users' needs so that I can build
the best solution possible. I specially like working with decisions
driven by data using **Hypothesis-Driven Development**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Double-Entry Bookkeeping Accounting
     systems in Elixir with Event Sourcing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kafka.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help on how to scale Double-Entry Bookkeeping
     systems, since they are often so reliant on sequencial operations
     per ledger.
- 💬 Ask me about Elixir, JavaScript, Node.js, HTTP Servers, middleware
     stack applications, Double-Entry Bookeeping, Financial Accounting,
     DevOps, CI/CD, Event Sourcing, CQRS, etc.
- 📫 You can reach me on 𝕏 Twitter: [`@rwillians_`](https://twitter.com/rwillians_).

  a library for handling errors in Express.js with a syntax similiar
  to Ruby's `rescue`.
